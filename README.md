# nanoGPT in MATLAB

This is a MATLAB® adaptation of Andrej Karpathy's online lecture ["Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy).

This demo builds and trains a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model to generate text based on a training data set of Shakespeare's sonnets. The model is built up step-by-step, starting from a completely random model and iterating until it generates recognizable Shakespearean text.

## Setup
### Requirements
* [MATLAB®](https://www.mathworks.com) 2023b or later
* [Deep Learning Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
* [Text Analytics Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/text-analytics.html)

Running the demo on a GPU also requires [Parallel Computing Toolbox™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) and supported hardware.

### Clone Repository
To run this demo with a local installation of MATLAB, first clone the repository.
1. In the system command prompt, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/nanogpt-in-matlab.git
```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Add the directory to the MATLAB path.
```
addpath("path/to/nanogpt-in-matlab");
```

## Run Demo
To run the full demo, open the live script `BuildNanoGPT.mlx` in the MATLAB Editor and click the **Run** button in the MATLAB Toolstrip. The script builds and trains a series of models increasing in size, complexity, and performance.
